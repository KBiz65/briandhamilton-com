            A job sheet is a rather large spreadsheet file housing pertinent
            information about a given machine. In my initial sketch I added a
            column of camera icons for each component.

            With the job sheets being so massive, it was discovered that it
            would take unncessary time to scroll through all the information, so
            I sketched out individual cards highlighting the most important
            information of each component in an easily digestible way.
