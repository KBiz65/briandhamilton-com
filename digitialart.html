        From July 1999 to September 2003 (right out of High School) I studied
        multimedia production and design. I lost quite a few of my old projects
        due to faulty storage. Luickly I was able to salvage some works. On this
        page you will find a handful of these projects and concepts behind them.

        At the time I created this, Garbage was a very influential band in my
        life. Shirley Manson did a photo spread for Cosmogirl magazine and for
        our illustration final, I chose this image to sketch in Adobe
        Illustrator.

          For our illustration midterm, we were to replicate a magazine ad in
          Adobe Illustrator. I chose this Oakley ad to showcase more advanced
          blending techniques. I thought to not make the O in the URL exact just
          to show that it was my own work.

          During our course study, we were to craft a project where we traced a
          black and white image of the human physique. While the majority of the
          class took to the curviture of the female form, I chose the harsh
          lines of the male form to create a postcard advertisement for a
          ficticious volleyball team.

          I was approached by a roommate, who was a member of the Jaycees, to
          assist in redesigning their brochure from a dated plain text version.
          Using both Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, I drafted several
          versions and ultimately this was the version she liked the most.
