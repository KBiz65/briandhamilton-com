          From July 1999 to September 2003 (right out of High School) I studied
          multimedia production and design. I lost quite a few of my old
          projects due to faulty storage. Luickly I was able to salvage some
          works. On this page you will find a handful of these projects and
          concepts behind them.

            At the time I created this, Garbage was a very influential band in
            my life. Shirley Manson did a photo spread for Cosmogirl magazine
            and for our illustration final, I chose this image to sketch in
            Adobe Illustrator.

            For our illustration midterm, we were to replicate a magazine ad in

            blending techniques. I thought to not make the O in the URL exact
            just to show that it was my own work.

            During our course study, we were to craft a project where we traced
            a black and white image of the human physique. While the majority of
            the class took to the curviture of the female form, I chose the
            harsh lines of the male form to create a postcard advertisement for
            a ficticious volleyball team.

            assist in redesigning their brochure from a dated plain text
            version. Using both Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, I drafted
            several versions and ultimately this was the version she liked the
            most.
